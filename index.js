(or you can use AIO Mod called ZombieAddons)\n\nTo get as much gold as possible, you'll be using Pistol + Shotgun by the time you get cp, they have the highest ratio of gold give per damage dealt (except flamethrower because it's too weak), and if you're in trouble, you may scarcely use a 3rd weapon or a skill, and that until you get Diamond Chestplate!\n\nOnce you have the Diamond Chestplate, tell your team to s1 (save 1 zombie alive)!\nYou should get:\nUnder cps 10~11: DBSG-RR set (DBSG, RR, ZZ, lrod)\nOver cps 10~11: GD-RR set (GD, RR,ZZ, lrod)\nOnce you're set, buy Extra Health when you can (5k, 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k)\n\nThe corners used:\n- Chest corner(cc), at the chest (the block where you have the chest at your right and the wall at your left).\n- Ultimate (ult) corner, in the ultimate machine, the 1-block space.\n- Alternative (alt) corner, in Ferris Wheel, at the back window, opposite side of the iron bars.\n- Perk corner(pc), the left side of the perk store. (The right one is opp-pc, opposite of pc)\n\nWhen you have N Giant (x-y-z) it means the N giants will spawn as a 1st wave of X giants, the second wave of giant will have Y giants and the 3rd one Z giants (n,x,y,z numbers).\n\n(If you are new to this mode please read all of this)\nGood Luck!";

The FB player should slow down giant first and other zombies too. Other players should focus on shooting magma zombies. (Giants' damage is much lower) You don't need to shoot at slimes because they give almost no damage. Use lightning when there are so many zombies at the corner. If you want to pass r85 and r95 more easily, one guy should do front and get back when giants are spawned.",

You will likely see more alive zombies than what is written in the scoreboard, that means some zombies are bugged or fake and can only be killed by melee.

Shoot the clowns and giants to slow them down. Other players should kill clowns as much as possible. After ledge comes back to the corner, you should make the revive-cycle.                 The Basic rules:                                  1 - Do knife guard until all o1s are dead.         2 - Revive ONLY one player. Don't try to revive 2+ players.
